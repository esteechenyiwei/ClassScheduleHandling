SUMMARY:BEPP250002
DESCRIPTION:This course will introduce you to "managerial economics" whic
 h is the application of microeconomic theory to managerial decision-maki
 ng. Microeconomic theory is a remarkably useful body of ideas for unders
 tanding and analyzing the behavior of individuals and firms in a variety
  of economic settings. The goal of the course is for you to understand t
 his body of theory well enough so that you can effectively analyze manag
 erial (and other) problems in an economic framework. While this is a "to
 ols" course\, we will cover many real-world applications\, particularly 
 business applications\, so that you can witness the usefulness of these 
 tools and acquire the skills to use them yourself. We will depart from t
 he usual microeconomic theory course by giving more emphasis to prescrip
 tion: What should a manager do in order to achieve some objective? That 
 course deliverable is to compare with description: Why do firms and cons
 umers act the way they do? The latter will still be quite prominent in t
 his course because only by understanding how other firms and customers b
 ehave can a manager determine what is beswt for him or her to do. Strate
 gic interaction is explored both in product markets and auctions. Finall
 y\, the challenges created by asymmetric information - both in the marke
 t and within the firm - are investigated.

SUMMARY:CIS 320001
DESCRIPTION:How do you optimally encode a text file? How do you find shor
 test paths in a map? How do you design a communication network? How do y
 ou route data in a network? What are the limits of efficient computation
 ? This course gives a comprehensive introduction to design and analysis 
 of algorithms\, and answers along the way to these and many other intere
 sting computational questions. You will learn about problem-solving\; ad
 vanced data structures such as universal hashing and red-black trees\; a
 dvanced design and analysis techniques such as dynamic programming and a
 mortized analysis\; graph algorithms such as minimum spanning trees and 
 network flows\; NP-completeness theory\; and approximation algorithms.

SUMMARY:CIS 350001
DESCRIPTION:You know how to write a "program". But how do you create a so
 ftware "product" as part of a team\, with customers that have expectatio
 ns of functionality and quality? This course introduces students to vari
 ous tools (source control\, automated build systems\, programming enviro
 nments\, test automation\, etc.) and processes (design\, implementation\
 , testing\, and maintenance) that are used by professionals in the field
  of software engineering. Topics will include: software development life
 cycle\; agile and test-driven development\; source control and continuou
 s integration\; requirements analysis\; object-oriented design and testa
 bility\; mobile and/or web application development\; software testing\; 
 refactoring \; and software quality metrics.

SUMMARY:ENGL104601
DESCRIPTION:This is an introduction to literary study through a survey of
  works from a specific historical period. Some versions will begin with 
 traditional stories or poems\, including a sampling of works in translat
 ion. Others will focus exclusively on modern and contemporary American s
 hort fiction or poetry. This course is designed or the General Requireme
 nt\, and is ideal for students wishing to take an English course but not
  necessarily intending to major. See the English Department's website at
  www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings.

SUMMARY:MGMT237001
DESCRIPTION:The course is designed to meet the needs of the future manage
 rs\, entrepreneurs\, consultants and investors who must analyze and deve
 lop business strategies in technology-based industries. The emphasis is 
 on learning conceptual models and frameworks to help navigate the comple
 xity and dynamism in such industries. This is not a course in new produc
 t development or in using information technology to improve business pro
 cesses and offerings. We will take a perspective of both established and
  emerging firms competing through technological innovations\, and study 
 the key strategic drivers of value creation and appropriation in the con
 text of business ecosystems.

SUMMARY:WH  201018
DESCRIPTION:The objective of WH 201 is to prepare you to communicate effe
 ctively as you pursue your educational\, professional\, and personal goa
 ls over the next few years. We have incorporated input from employers\, 
 employees\, alumni and past WH 201 students to create a course that will
  prepare you to succeed at all types of communication: spoken and writte
 n\, formal and informal\, prepared and spontaneous. Communication is a s
 kill that requires repeated practice to master. The class size is limite
 d to eight students to allow you the opportunity to practice communicati
 ng every week. Class will meet for 80 minutes once a week for fourteen w
 eeks. Please note that we are piloting different approaches to teaching 
 this year in different sections of the course. The logistical details of
  some sections may differ from others\, but everyone will be taught the 
 same material and complete the same assignments.
