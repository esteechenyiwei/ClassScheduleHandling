 ur series introducing students to computer science. In this class you wi
 ll learn the fundamentals of computer programming in Java\, with emphasi
 s on applications in science and engineering. You will also learn about 
 the broader field of computer science and algorithmic thinking\, the fun
 damental approach that computer scientists take to solving problems.

SUMMARY:DSGN264406
DESCRIPTION:This course is an introduction to the fundamental perception\
 , representation\, aesthetics\, and design that shape today's visual cul
 ture. It addresses the way artists and designers create images\; design 
 with analog and digital tools\; communicate\, exchange\, and express mea
 ning over a broad range of media\; and find their voices within the fabr
 ic of contemporary art\, design\, and visual culture. Emphasis is placed
  on building an extended form of visual literacy by studying and making 
 images using a variety of representation techniques\; learning to organi
 ze and structure two-dimensional and three-dimensional space\, and desig
 ning with time-based and procedural media. Students learn to develop an 
 individual style of idea-generation\, experimentation\, iteration\, and 
 critique as part of their creative and critical responses to visual cult
 ure. If you need assistance registering for a closed section\, please em
 ail the department at fnarug@design.upenn.edu

SUMMARY:MGMT101002
DESCRIPTION:We all spend much of our lives in organizations. Most of us a
 re born in organizations\, educated in organizations\, and work in organ
 izations. Organizations emerge because individuals can't (or don't want 
 to) accomplish their goals alone. Management is the art and science of h
 elping individuals achieve their goals together. Managers in an organiza
 tion determine where their organization is going and how it gets there. 
 More formally\, managers formulate strategies and implement those strate
 gies. This course provides a framework for understanding the opportuniti
 es and challenges involved in formulating and implementing strategies by
  taking a "system" view of organizations\,which means that we examine mu
 ltiple aspects of how managers address their environments\, strategy\, s
 tructure\, culture\, tasks\, people\, and outputs\, and how managerial d
 ecisions made in these various domains interrelate. The course will help
  you to understand and analyze how managers can formulate and implement 
 strategies effectively. It will be particularly valuable if you are inte
 rested in management consulting\, investment analysis\, or entrepreneurs
 hip - but it will help you to better understand and be a more effective 
 contributor to any organizations you join\, whether they are large\, est
 ablished firms or startups. This course must be taken for a grade.

SUMMARY:MGMT264001
DESCRIPTION:This course focuses on venture capital management issues in t
 he context of a high-growth potential start-up company. The course is mo
 tivated by rapid increases in both the supply of and demand for private 
 equity over the past two decades. The topic is addressed from two distin
 ct perspectives: issues that relate to the demand for private equity and
  venture capital (the entrepreneur's perspective) on the one hand\, and 
 issues that relate to the supply of capital (the investor's perspective)
  on the other. As well\, we will address management issues that relate t
 o how the VC and the entrepreneur work together once an investment has b
 een made\, compensation issues\, and governance issues in the privately 
 held venture capital backed company. Format: Case/discussion format\, su
 pplemented by lectures and guest speakers.

SUMMARY:MKTG476403
DESCRIPTION:This course will expose students to the theoretical and empir
 ical "building blocks" that will allow them to construct\, estimate\, an
 d interpret powerful models of consumer behavior. Over the years\, resea
 rchers and practitioners have used these models for a wide variety of ap
 plications\, such as new product sales\, forecasting\, analyses of media
  usage\, and targeted marketing programs. Other disciplines have seen eq
 ually broad utilization of these techniques. The course will be entirely
  lecture-based with a strong emphasis on real-time problem solving. Most
  sessions will feature sophisticated numerical investigations using Micr
 osoft Excel. Much of the material is highly technical.

SUMMARY:WH  201050
DESCRIPTION:The objective of WH 201 is to prepare you to communicate effe
 ctively as you pursue your educational\, professional\, and personal goa
 ls over the next few years. We have incorporated input from employers\, 
 employees\, alumni and past WH 201 students to create a course that will
  prepare you to succeed at all types of communication: spoken and writte
 n\, formal and informal\, prepared and spontaneous. Communication is a s
 kill that requires repeated practice to master. The class size is limite
 d to eight students to allow you the opportunity to practice communicati
 ng every week. Class will meet for 80 minutes once a week for fourteen w
 eeks. Please note that we are piloting different approaches to teaching 
 this year in different sections of the course. The logistical details of
  some sections may differ from others\, but everyone will be taught the 
 same material and complete the same assignments.
