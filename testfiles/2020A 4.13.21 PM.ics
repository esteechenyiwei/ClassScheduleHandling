SUMMARY:CIS 350001
DESCRIPTION:You know how to write a "program". But how do you create a so
 ftware "product" as part of a team\, with customers that have expectatio
 ns of functionality and quality? This course introduces students to vari
 ous tools (source control\, automated build systems\, programming enviro
 nments\, test automation\, etc.) and processes (design\, implementation\
 , testing\, and maintenance) that are used by professionals in the field
  of software engineering. Topics will include: software development life
 cycle\; agile and test-driven development\; source control and continuou
 s integration\; requirements analysis\; object-oriented design and testa
 bility\; mobile and/or web application development\; software testing\; 
 refactoring \; and software quality metrics.

SUMMARY:EAS 203001
DESCRIPTION:In this course\, students will study the social\, political\,
  environmental and economic context of engineering practice. Students wi
 ll develop an analytical toolkit to identify and address ethical challen
 ges and opportunities in the engineering profession\, including studies 
 of risk and safety\, professional responsibility\, and global perspectiv
 es. The course will begin with a foundation in the history of engineerin
 g practice and major Western ethical and philosophical theories. Student
 s will then apply this material to both historical case studies\, such a
 s Bhopal\, the NASA Shuttle Program\, and Three Mile Island\, as well as
  contemporary issues in big data\, artificial intelligence\, and diversi
 ty within the profession. Students will consider how engineers\, as well
  as governments\, the media\, and other stakeholders\, address such issu
 es.

SUMMARY:MGMT264001
DESCRIPTION:This course focuses on venture capital management issues in t
 he context of a high-growth potential start-up company. The course is mo
 tivated by rapid increases in both the supply of and demand for private 
 equity over the past two decades. The topic is addressed from two distin
 ct perspectives: issues that relate to the demand for private equity and
  venture capital (the entrepreneur's perspective) on the one hand\, and 
 issues that relate to the supply of capital (the investor's perspective)
  on the other. As well\, we will address management issues that relate t
 o how the VC and the entrepreneur work together once an investment has b
 een made\, compensation issues\, and governance issues in the privately 
 held venture capital backed company. Format: Case/discussion format\, su
 pplemented by lectures and guest speakers.
