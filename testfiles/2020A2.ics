SUMMARY:FREN140305
DESCRIPTION:French 140 is the second half of a two-semester intermediate 
 sequence designed to help you attain a level of proficiency that should 
 allow you to function comfortably in a French-speaking environment. You 
 are expected to have already learned the most basic grammatical structur
 es in elementary French and you will review these on your own in the cou
 rse workbook. This course will build on your existing skills in French\,
  increase your confidence and ability to read\, write\, speak and unders
 tand French\, and introduce you to more refined lexical items\, more com
 plex grammatical structures\, and more challenging cultural material. Th
 is course focuses on the culture of French-speaking countries beyond the
  borders of France. Along with your classmates\, you will explore the ci
 ties of Dakar\, Fort-de-France and Marrakesh\, investigating the diversi
 ty of the Francophone world through film\, literature and music. As in o
 ther French courses at Penn\, class is conducted entirely in French. In 
 addition to structured oral practice\, work in class will include freque
 nt communicative activities such as problem-solving tasks\, discussions\
 , and debates\, often carried out in pairs or small groups. Daily homewo
 rk will require researching in the library and on the Internet\, listeni
 ng practice with video clips\, in addition to regular written exercises 
 in the workbook.

SUMMARY:WH  201034
DESCRIPTION:The objective of WH 201 is to prepare you to communicate effe
 ctively as you pursue your educational\, professional\, and personal goa
 ls over the next few years. We have incorporated input from employers\, 
 employees\, alumni and past WH 201 students to create a course that will
  prepare you to succeed at all types of communication: spoken and writte
 n\, formal and informal\, prepared and spontaneous. Communication is a s
 kill that requires repeated practice to master. The class size is limite
 d to eight students to allow you the opportunity to practice communicati
 ng every week. Class will meet for 80 minutes once a week for fourteen w
 eeks. Please note that we are piloting different approaches to teaching 
 this year in different sections of the course. The logistical details of
  some sections may differ from others\, but everyone will be taught the 
 same material and complete the same assignments.
