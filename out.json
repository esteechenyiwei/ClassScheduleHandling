It addresses the way artists and designers create images; design with analog and digital tools; communicate, exchange, and express meaning over a broad range of media; and find their voices within the fabric of contemporary art, design, and visual culture. Emphasis is placed on building an extended form of visual literacy by studying and making images using a variety of representation techniques; learning to organize and structure two-dimensional and three-dimensional space, and designing with time-based and procedural media. Students learn to develop an individual style of idea-generation, experimentation, iteration, and critique as part of their creative and critical responses to visual culture.

Most of us are born in organizations, educated in organizations, and work in organizations. Organizations emerge because individuals can't (or don't want to) accomplish their goals alone. Management is the art and science of helping individuals achieve their goals together. Managers in an organization determine where their organization is going and how it gets there. More formally, managers formulate strategies and implement those strategies. This course provides a framework for understanding the opportunities and challenges involved in formulating and implementing strategies by taking a \"system\" view of organizations,which means that we examine multiple aspects of how managers address their environments, strategy, structure, culture, tasks, people, and outputs, and how managerial decisions made in these various domains interrelate. The course will help you to understand and analyze how managers can formulate and implement strategies effectively. It will be particularly valuable if you are interested in management consulting, investment analysis, or entrepreneurship - but it will help you to better understand and be a more effective contributor to any organizations you join, whether they are large, established firms or startups. This course must be taken for a grade.","dayofweek":"MO","location":"SHDH 350","starttime":"1030"}, {"name":"MGMT101202","endtime":"1200","description":"We all spend much of our lives in organizations.

The course is motivated by rapid increases in both the supply of and demand for private equity over the past two decades. The topic is addressed from two distinct perspectives: issues that relate to the demand for private equity and venture capital (the entrepreneur's perspective) on the one hand, and issues that relate to the supply of capital (the investor's perspective) on the other. As well, we will address management issues that relate to how the VC and the entrepreneur work together once an investment has been made, compensation issues, and governance issues in the privately held venture capital backed company. Format: Case\/discussion format, supplemented by lectures and guest speakers.","dayofweek":"MO","location":"SHDH 211","starttime":"1330"}, {"name":"MGMT264001","endtime":"1500","description":"This course focuses on venture capital management issues in the context of a high-growth potential start-up company.

Over the years, researchers and practitioners have used these models for a wide variety of applications, such as new product sales, forecasting, analyses of media usage, and targeted marketing programs. Other disciplines have seen equally broad utilization of these techniques. The course will be entirely lecture-based with a strong emphasis on real-time problem solving. Most sessions will feature sophisticated numerical investigations using Microsoft Excel. Much of the material is highly technical.","dayofweek":"WE","location":"JMHH 270","starttime":"1500"}, {"name":"WH  201050","endtime":"1630","description":"The objective of WH 201 is to prepare you to communicate effectively as you pursue your educational, professional, and personal goals over the next few years. We have incorporated input from employers, employees, alumni and past WH 201 students to create a course that will prepare you to succeed at all types of communication: spoken and written, formal and informal, prepared and spontaneous. Communication is a skill that requires repeated practice to master. The class size is limited to eight students to allow you the opportunity to practice communicating every week. Class will meet for 80 minutes once a week for fourteen weeks. Please note that we are piloting different approaches to teaching this year in different sections of the course. The logistical details of some sections may differ from others, but everyone will be taught the same material and complete the same assignments.","dayofweek":"TH","location":"SHDH 204A","starttime":"1500"}]
